Work and personal commitments kept me writing these posts regularly.
A lot has changed in the market in the last four weeks. It is with great pleasure we see some upside to the market, although today seem to be a wide spread down day on all three major indices.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 07-18-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-07182022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-07182022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 31,072.61 -215.65 -0.69 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,830.85 -32.31 -0.84 Nasdaq 11,360.05 -92.37 -0.81 Russel 2K 1,738.42 -5.96 -0.34 VIX 25.30 1.07 4.42 What a turn of events. Dow up 350 plus in the early trading, only to close -216 at the closing. All major indices gave up their gains and went into solid red. VIX edged up almost 5 percent. At the time of writing this post, all indices futures are flat.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 07-15-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-07152022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-07152022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 31,288.26 -192.51 -0.62 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,863.16 72.78 1.92 Nasdaq 11,452.42 201.24 1.79 Russel 2K 1,744.37 36.87 2.16 VIX 24.23 -2.17 -8.22 I have taken few days break from writing my closing bell summary. Many things have happened in the last few days, unfortunately market taking a turn for the worst. All indices were mostly negative.
Today, there is much needed market rally with all indices in solid green territory and also VIX dropping below 25.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 07-12-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-07122022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-07122022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 30,981.33 -192.51 -0.62 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,818.80 -35.63 -0.92 Nasdaq 11,364.73 -107.87 -0.95 Russel 2K 1,728.18 -3.83 -0.22 VIX 27.29 1.12 4.28 Yet another red day - VERY red day I should add. All eyes are on tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s CPI report. I think market is pricing in a very bad news. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe Powell fooled us stating &amp;ldquo;Inflation is transitory&amp;rdquo;.

All indices had an awesome week. Better than expected job data eased investors mind of recession. I still think we are either already in one or moderate recession is unavoidable.

All indices are up and VIX dropping. China considers massive 250 billion dollar stimulus with historic bond sales. This news helped various chinese and us stocks that have business in China such as Tesla.

I am not complaining, but just stating that volatility is at its worst or so it seems. All major indexes end up in green territory. Russell 2000 was down which measures growth sectors.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 07-05-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-07052022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-07052022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 30,967.82 -129.44 -0.42 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,831.39 6.06 0.16 Nasdaq 11,322.24 194.40 1.75 Russel 2K 1,741.33 13.57 0.79 VIX 27.54 0.01 0.04 The roller coaster ride of the market is worst than the rides in Magic Mountain!

We see that in the market today. In a highly volatile market, with swings of almost 600 points in Dow. At the end all indices end up higher almost one percent. VIX dropped below 28 with 7 percent decline, which indicates general FUD in market is stabilizing.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 6-30-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-06302022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-06302022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 30,775.43 -253.88 -0.82 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,785.38 -33.45 -0.88 Nasdaq 11,028.74 -149.16 -1.33 Russel 2K 1,707.99 -11.38 -0.96 VIX 28.60 0.44 1.86 Stock market closes with yet another red day. The marketâ€™s worst first half in 50 years. This is definitely something to be worried about and not just general FUD. Feds are determined to get inflation numbers down, however, the persistent inflation is here to stay at least for the short term.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 6-29-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-06292022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-06292022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 31,029.31 82.32 0.27 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,818.83 -2.72 -0.07 Nasdaq 11,177.89 -3.65 -0.03 Russel 2K 1,719.37 -24.79 -1.86 VIX 28.16 0.20 -0.71 A volatile day.

Tesla stock is under fire, and heading towards hitting 650 a share. Recent news include, lay off of employees. Goldman expects weak Tesla results. Various analysts are revising their second quarter delivery numbers sighting issues with Covid shutdown in China etc.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 6-28-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-06282022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-06282022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 30,946.99 -491.27 -1.56 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,821.55 -78.56 -2.01 Nasdaq 11,181.54 -343.01 -2.98 Russel 2K 1,738.84 -32.90 -1.86 VIX 28.36 1.41 5.23 Massive red days are back! All indices are in deep red territory with VIX surging back up above 28 again. Cathie Wood believes US is already in a recession. I think as the month June ends and the market wraps up one of the worst six months of the year in stock market history, we can start to see some uptrend.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 6-27-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-06272022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-06272022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 31,438.26 -62.42 -0.20 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,900.11 -11.63 -0.30 Nasdaq 11,524.55 -83.07 -0.72 Russel 2K 1,771.74 6.01 0.34 VIX 26.95 -0.28 -1.03 Not a green day but not that red either - which is surprising.
