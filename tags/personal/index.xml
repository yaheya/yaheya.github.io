&lt;p>&lt;strong>Work Update:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the professional side, we’re making solid progress on our massive ERP project: the Oracle Financial Cloud deployment. This project is a beast, with over a hundred swim lanes of technical and functional scopes. It’s definitely a challenge to keep up with everything that needs to be done between now and our launch date in July 2025. But hey, nothing worth doing ever comes easy, right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My YouTube Channel iGluon</title><link>/post/igluon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/igluon/</guid><description>&lt;p>Those who know or follow me know I had my own Sole proprietorship in the early 1990s. I am very proud of what I did with my business back then; unfortunately, I had to close that business eventually due to demand from my daytime job. Recently, I started a new YouTube channel based on my old business name, &amp;ldquo;iGluon.&amp;rdquo; I have a lot of ideas to create content that users may find helpful. But for now, I posted a few videos; the acceptance was incredible. In less than a month, my channel got over 8,000 views. My subscriber grew from 3 to 28 also. This is good progress, and I would love to keep up the momentum.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Embracing 2024: A Year of Reflection and Renewal</title><link>/post/welcome-2024/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/welcome-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we step into the fresh canvas of 2024, I find myself in a reflective mood, contemplating the journey we&amp;rsquo;ve all been through and the exciting path that lies ahead. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just another year; it&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for growth, resilience, and embracing new possibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the realm of software development, the pace of innovation continues to astonish us. As the Chief Software Architect at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed firsthand the remarkable strides we&amp;rsquo;ve made in technology. The challenges we face are met with ingenious solutions, and our commitment to pushing boundaries remains unwavering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exciting Milestone in my Software Engineering Journey!</title><link>/post/pc-to-mac/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/pc-to-mac/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to share a monumental shift in my 30-plus years of software engineering career – the decision to make the Mac my primary work station! 🍎&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back, my journey began with Windows, possibly starting with the era of Windows 3.0. It&amp;rsquo;s where I acquired my foundational computing skills and built the pillars of my engineering career, primarily on various Microsoft platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As technology advanced, so did my tools. Today, nearly everything essential for my work seamlessly runs on a Mac. From &lt;em>Visual Studio Code/Visual Studio&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Microsoft Office&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Edge/Chrome Browser&lt;/em>, to &lt;em>Azure Data Studio&lt;/em> (a shift from SSMS), and &lt;em>.Net Core&lt;/em> – each performs as well, if not better, than on my trusted Windows platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Depeche Mode Suffer Well Vinyl</title><link>/post/depeche-mode-suffer-well/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/depeche-mode-suffer-well/</guid><description>&lt;p>Diving into the final chapter of our Depeche Mode series with &amp;ldquo;Suffer Well.&amp;rdquo; 🎶 Immerse yourself in the magnetic sounds of Dave Gahan that truly captivate in this track. 🌟 Enjoy the ride! 🚀 Also, spiced it up with clips from the unforgettable Memento Mori concert in Las Vegas, December 2023. 🎤🔥&lt;/p>

At the end of 2022, I would like to share 12 hand-picked ayaat (verses) from the Quran. May 2023 brings you happiness, peace and prosper.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>So remember me I will remember you: Baqarah 152&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good. Alaraf 56&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned. Anbiya 35&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts Al-Haj 46&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repel evil with that which is better. Al Muminun 96&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps it is close behind you - some of that for which you are impatient. Namlayat 72&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be, and it is. His command is only when he inteds a thing that he says to it &amp;ldquo;Be, and it is&amp;rdquo; Yasin 82&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is the reward for good [anything] but good? Ar-Rahman 60&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And whoever puts all his trust in Allah (SWT) he will be enough for him At-Talaq 3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Verily with every hardship comes ease Ash-Sharh 5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And when I am ill, it is He who cures me Ash-Shuara 80&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recite in the name of your Lord who created man from a clinging substance. Al-Alaq 1&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The sura is Taha in Quran, and the sura summarizes the entire adventure when Allah appeared to Prophet Musa in the holy mountains of Tuwa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a few consecutive Ayaat, the sura describes the conversation between Allah and Musa. One of these conversations that touches me the most is when Allah asked Musa to go to Feraun to spread his word. Musa asks Allah, among other wishes, to remove his stutter and give him strength so that his voice and appearance are convincible to Feraun. Allah accepts his desire and says, &amp;ldquo;All that you requested has been granted, O Moses! &amp;quot; instantaneously.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bing Image Gallery and Power Automate</title><link>/post/bing-image-gallery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/bing-image-gallery/</guid><description>&lt;p>I downloaded the Bing &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-wallpaper?pc=W016&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrs0lbnSDb49ufCoyZPgW1J5XaEwN6n65MOUb7XTVzkHckVbkQWV8AxoC8a4QAvD_BwE">wallpaper&lt;/a> app. It is actually awesome, everyday I turn on my computer to see what kind of wall paper I get for that day.
