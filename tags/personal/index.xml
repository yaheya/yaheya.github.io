At the end of 2022, I would like to share 12 hand-picked ayaat (verses) from the Quran. May 2023 brings you happiness, peace and prosper.
So remember me I will remember you: Baqarah 152 Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good. Alaraf 56 Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.</description></item><item><title>My YouTube Channel iGluon</title><link>/post/igluon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/igluon/</guid><description>Those who know or follow me know I had my own Sole proprietorship in the early 1990s.
