A Quick post this time - 

I stumbled upon a great workflow feature in Copilot today that I wanted to share.

While in a long session, Copilot suggested taking a break and offered to create a Handoff Note. This allows you to pause your work without losing the context of your discussion or code changes.

How to use it:

End of day: Ask Copilot to "document our discussion and changes into a handoff note."

Storage: Save that note in a dedicated folder for easy retrieval.

Next morning: Start your session by saying, "Please read [Handoff Note Name] and suggest next steps."

It’s a fantastic way to pick up exactly where you left off!
