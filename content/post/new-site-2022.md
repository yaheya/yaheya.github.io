After many years, moved my personal site to Hugo, previously DotNet Core Azure Web App. Details of current site can be found [here](/about/)

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is the main platform this site runs under is a brilliant idea. Not all sites, needs to be generated off from a Database or need backend server technology.

The site features -

1. Google Analytics
2. Disqus comments
3. Contact form using Formspree

Overtime I plan to add many features and post about them as I am doing so. One such post is [here](../hugo-stock-summary-shortcode).

**RUpdate : Updated Hugo to new version
