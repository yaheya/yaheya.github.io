# üöÄ Exciting Milestone in my Software Engineering Journey! üöÄ

Today, I'm thrilled to share a monumental shift in my 30-plus years of software engineering career ‚Äì the decision to make the Mac my primary work station! üçé

Looking back, my journey began with Windows, possibly starting with the era of Windows 3.0. It's where I acquired my foundational computing skills and built the pillars of my engineering career, primarily on various Microsoft platforms.

As technology advanced, so did my tools. Today, nearly everything essential for my work seamlessly runs on a Mac. From *Visual Studio Code/Visual Studio*, *Microsoft Office*, *Edge/Chrome Browser*, to *Azure Data Studio* (a shift from SSMS), and *.Net Core* ‚Äì each performs as well, if not better, than on my trusted Windows platform.

## Current Workstation: Mac Mini

- **Apple M2 Pro Chip:** The powerhouse behind my Mac Mini, providing efficient processing and performance.
  
- **16 GB Memory:** Ensuring smooth multitasking capabilities, crucial for handling complex software development tasks.

- **512 GB SSD HD:** Ample storage space for my projects and applications, contributing to faster data access and overall system responsiveness.

- **Sonoma 14.2.1:** Running on the latest Sonoma version, embracing the latest features and enhancements in the Mac ecosystem.

## Previous Machine: Dell Inspiron

Farewell to my faithful Dell Inspiron, a workhorse that served me well:

- **Intel i7 Processor:** Delivering the processing power needed for demanding development tasks.

- **32 GB RAM:** Enabling seamless multitasking and efficient handling of resource-intensive applications.

- **265 GB SSD HD:** While slightly smaller than my Mac's storage, it provided sufficient space for my projects.

- **Windows 11:** The operating system that accompanied me through numerous coding marathons and project completions.

This transition signifies more than just a change in hardware and operating systems. It's a shift in perspective, embracing new possibilities and exploring the full potential of the Mac ecosystem as my primary development environment.

Here's to embracing change, continuous learning, and the exciting journey ahead in the realm of software engineering! üöÄüíª #MacSwitch #SoftwareEngineeringJourney #NewBeginnings
