<strong>Happy New Year, everyone! Welcome to 2026.</strong>

<p>As the calendar turns a new page, I find myself reflecting on the moments that brought us here—the joys, the challenges, and the quiet resilience we’ve all built. As per my yearly tradition, I wanted to share something that grounds me and brings peace to my soul.</p>

<p>No matter what this new year holds, there is timeless comfort to be found in the words of the Quran. Here are 10 verses that I hope will wrap your heart in warmth, remind you of your strength, and reassure you that you are never walking alone.
