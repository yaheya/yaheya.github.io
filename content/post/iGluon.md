Those who know or follow me know I had my own Sole proprietorship in the early 1990s. I am very proud of what I did with my business back then; unfortunately, I had to close that business eventually due to demand from my daytime job. Recently, I started a new YouTube channel based on my old business name, "iGluon." I have a lot of ideas to create content that users may find helpful. But for now, I posted a few videos; the acceptance was incredible. In less than a month, my channel got over 8,000 views. My subscriber grew from 3 to 28 also. This is good progress, and I would love to keep up the momentum.

Here is my YouTube Channel, please visit, like if you enjoy my videos and suggest future content. Look forward to seeing you all in my YouTube channel! [iGluon](https://www.youtube.com/@igluon2022)
