For listeners whose primary focus is two-channel (stereo) music listening, especially the rich, analog sound of vinyl records, a dedicated integrated stereo amplifier (often just called a stereo amplifier) is generally preferred over a multi-channel AV receiver (AVR). This preference is rooted in audio fidelity, design philosophy, and specific requirements for turntable playback.

1. Focus on Audio Purity and Quality
An integrated stereo amplifier is designed with a single, uncompromising goal: to take a two-channel signal and amplify it with the highest possible fidelity.

Dedicated Resources: A stereo amplifier channels its entire budget and design effort into only two amplifier channels (Left and Right), plus a pre-amplifier section. This means the manufacturer can invest in higher-quality components for the power supply, capacitors, and internal circuitry compared to an AVR at a similar price point.

Less Interference (Simpler Design): AV receivers are complex hubs that house not only multiple amplifier channels (5.1, 7.1, 9.2, etc.) but also numerous video processors, digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and surround-sound decoding chips (Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, etc.). This abundance of digital and video circuitry in close proximity can introduce electrical noise that can subtly degrade the delicate analog audio signal. A stereo amplifier has a much simpler internal layout, leading to a "cleaner" signal path.

Targeted Power: While an AVR may advertise high wattage, that power is often split among seven or more channels. A dedicated stereo amplifier's power rating is solely for the two main channels, ensuring it can better drive demanding or larger stereo speakers to their full potential without strain.

2. The Essential Phono Stage for Turntables
The signal produced by a turntable's cartridge is extremely weak and requires special treatment—it is not a standard "line-level" signal like that from a CD player or streamer.

Amplification and Equalization: A turntable signal needs to be amplified to line level, and it also requires RIAA equalization (Recording Industry Association of America curve) to correct the severe low-frequency cut and high-frequency boost applied during the vinyl mastering process. This essential component is called a phono stage or phono preamp.

Superior Built-in Phono Stages: High-quality integrated stereo amplifiers, particularly those built by hi-fi companies, are much more likely to include a high-performance, dedicated phono input. This built-in phono stage is often superior in quality to the one found in budget-to-mid-range AV receivers, which may treat the phono stage as an afterthought.

Analog Preservation: Vinyl playback is a fundamentally analog process. Stereo amplifiers are typically better optimized for handling, preserving, and amplifying this purely analog signal path without unnecessary digital conversion, which can be critical for audiophiles seeking the authentic "warmth" of vinyl.
