Hey everyone! I know it's been a while since my last update â€“ things have been incredibly busy with both work and my YouTube channel!

**Work Update:**

On the professional side, weâ€™re making solid progress on our massive ERP project: the Oracle Financial Cloud deployment. This project is a beast, with over a hundred swim lanes of technical and functional scopes. Itâ€™s definitely a challenge to keep up with everything that needs to be done between now and our launch date in July 2025. But hey, nothing worth doing ever comes easy, right?

**Personal News:**

On a personal note, my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@igluonvinyls) is growing faster than I ever imagined! Iâ€™ve almost hit 200 posts and, as of now, I have 609 subscribers! ðŸŽ‰ I never thought Iâ€™d see this level of engagement, so Iâ€™m feeling incredibly grateful.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with a podcast-style album/music review format. My first one, on David Gilmourâ€™s new '[Luck and Strange](https://youtu.be/wBdW8fHPy-8?si=I5l8ap8v8BrQQWmo)' album, was a hit! The positive feedback has motivated me, so stay tuned for another review coming soon.

**Tech Front:**

Iâ€™ve also been diving deeper into cinematography, color grading, and video editing to make my content even more immersive. Itâ€™s a learning curve, but I'm loving every moment of it!

Hope youâ€™re all doing well. If you get a chance, swing by my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@igluonvinyls) â€“ would love to hear your thoughts!

Take care and God bless!
