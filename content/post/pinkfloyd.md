I am a classic Rock fan. I bought a ticket to go with my brothers and daughter to see Roger Waters - This is not a drill in Cryptoarena Los Angeles.

The quality of the concert, sound, the environment was absolutely unreal to say the least. However, I must admit Roger's politics is truly crazy. A picture collage of the event with family is below.

I post a video of the opening in YouTube which got an expected number of views in a short time. Feel free to watch it [here](https://youtu.be/OUgTpLPYNrE)
