## Summary

As a seasoned Technology Executive with over 27 years of experience at the University of California and other Higher Educational institutions, I possess a deep passion for and understanding of Software Engineering and Software Lifecycle Management. Throughout my career, I have taken on roles of increasing responsibility, including serving as the founding Technology Executive for the University of California at Merced's first 21st-century research university campus.

As the Chief Software Architect at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I lead the development strategy, architectural oversight, process definition, project management, and product releases. I am an accomplished technology leader with a proven track record of success in diverse entrepreneurial development and program management experiences, including premier academic settings, state and city, and small startups.

I am passionate about emerging technologies and possess the expertise to lead complex projects with collaborative teams, conduct detailed analyses, and formulate innovative customer-centric solutions that meet business objectives and customer expectations. My colleagues, business leaders, and stakeholders all respect my resiliency, resourcefulness, and unwavering commitment to excellence and integrity.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated the ability to build, orchestrate, and operate large-scale mission-focused technology teams in consolidated and federated environments, including mergers and acquisitions. I am skilled at collaborating with and coordinating federated teams across complex social and organizational structures.

As an experienced architect, I can create solutions for the most socially complex and challenging enterprise-wide collaborations, strategy formulation, major transformation, information assurance/security, technology envisioning, and operational excellence opportunities. My experience, passion, and expertise make me a valuable asset to any organization.
