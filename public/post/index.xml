      <title>More Than a Movie: My Pilgrimage to David Gilmour’s Live at the Circus Maximus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about an experience I had last night. I didn&amp;rsquo;t just go to the movies. As I noted in my recent review, it felt more like a &amp;ldquo;pilgrimage.&amp;rdquo; The film was David Gilmour&amp;rsquo;s Live at the Circus Maximus, and it felt like a temporal echo—a chance to relive a legendary performance on a scale so grand it felt like you were breathing the very air of that historic night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building Scalable and Resilient Cloud Applications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the privilege of presenting to the Developer Collaboration group at UC Santa Barbara, a gathering of both Software Developers and Infrastructure Engineers.  The topic was &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native Application Development&lt;/strong&gt;, but the underlying theme was much deeper: the urgent need to bridge the historical divide between those who write the code and those who manage the systems that run it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, the industry relied on a Lift and Shift strategy.  While this moved us to the cloud, it often failed to unlock true application scalability and infrastructure efficiency.  To move forward, we have to acknowledge that infrastructure considerations can no longer be an afterthought—they must become integral to the application development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year, everyone! Welcome to 2026.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the calendar turns a new page, I find myself reflecting on the moments that brought us here—the joys, the challenges, and the quiet resilience we’ve all built. As per my yearly tradition, I wanted to share something that grounds me and brings peace to my soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what this new year holds, there is timeless comfort to be found in the words of the Quran. Here are 10 verses that I hope will wrap your heart in warmth, remind you of your strength, and reassure you that you are never walking alone. May 2026 be a year of ease, growth, and abundant mercy for us all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stereo Amplifiers: The Audiophile&#39;s choice for 2.1 and Vinyl</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/amp-versus-reciever/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/amp-versus-reciever/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For listeners whose primary focus is two-channel (stereo) music listening, especially the rich, analog sound of vinyl records, a dedicated integrated stereo amplifier (often just called a stereo amplifier) is generally preferred over a multi-channel AV receiver (AVR). This preference is rooted in audio fidelity, design philosophy, and specific requirements for turntable playback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Focus on Audio Purity and Quality&#xA;An integrated stereo amplifier is designed with a single, uncompromising goal: to take a two-channel signal and amplify it with the highest possible fidelity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated Resources: A stereo amplifier channels its entire budget and design effort into only two amplifier channels (Left and Right), plus a pre-amplifier section. This means the manufacturer can invest in higher-quality components for the power supply, capacitors, and internal circuitry compared to an AVR at a similar price point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bedrock&#39;s Game Changer: Why Cross-Region LLM Inference is a Must-Have</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/bedrock/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/bedrock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Chief Software Architect at UC Santa Barbara, I focus on integrating cutting-edge cloud features like AWS Bedrock. For enterprise LLM deployment, we must solve three non-negotiables: latency, data gravity, and resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cross-region inference in Bedrock is the definitive answer, moving LLM strategy from experiment to production-grade architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pillars of Multi-Region LLM Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High Resiliency and Failover&#xA;Single-region deployment is a critical vulnerability. Cross-region inference allows immediate, automatic failover (e.g., from us-east-1 to us-west-2). This maintains API parity and model consistency across geographies, guaranteeing uninterrupted service for critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review of David Gilmour&#39;s new album : Luck and Strange</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/review-luckandstrange/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/review-luckandstrange/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;🎵 David Gilmour’s much-anticipated album Luck and Strange dropped on September 6, marking his first release in nine years since Rattle That Lock. Fans were eagerly waiting, especially after preview tracks like &amp;ldquo;The Piper’s Call,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Between Two Points,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dark and Velvet Nights&amp;rdquo; hinted at a mix of the familiar Pink Floyd essence and something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gilmour doesn’t disappoint. Luck and Strange is a beautifully crafted work with his signature sound—soaring guitar solos, bluesy undertones, and moments of poignant calm. The album features contributions from his family: daughter Romany shines on &amp;ldquo;Between Two Points&amp;rdquo; and duets on the bonus track &amp;ldquo;Yes, I Have Ghosts.&amp;rdquo; His late Pink Floyd bandmate Rick Wright&amp;rsquo;s electric piano, recorded years before, also makes an appearance, further deepening the connection to his past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! I know it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last update – things have been incredibly busy with both work and my YouTube channel!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the professional side, we’re making solid progress on our massive ERP project: the Oracle Financial Cloud deployment. This project is a beast, with over a hundred swim lanes of technical and functional scopes. It’s definitely a challenge to keep up with everything that needs to be done between now and our launch date in July 2025. But hey, nothing worth doing ever comes easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who know or follow me know I had my own Sole proprietorship in the early 1990s. I am very proud of what I did with my business back then; unfortunately, I had to close that business eventually due to demand from my daytime job. Recently, I started a new YouTube channel based on my old business name, &amp;ldquo;iGluon.&amp;rdquo; I have a lot of ideas to create content that users may find helpful. But for now, I posted a few videos; the acceptance was incredible. In less than a month, my channel got over 8,000 views. My subscriber grew from 3 to 28 also. This is good progress, and I would love to keep up the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As the Chief Software Architect at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed firsthand the remarkable strides we&amp;rsquo;ve made in technology. The challenges we face are met with ingenious solutions, and our commitment to pushing boundaries remains unwavering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exciting Milestone in my Software Engineering Journey!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to share a monumental shift in my 30-plus years of software engineering career – the decision to make the Mac my primary work station! 🍎&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, my journey began with Windows, possibly starting with the era of Windows 3.0. It&amp;rsquo;s where I acquired my foundational computing skills and built the pillars of my engineering career, primarily on various Microsoft platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As technology advanced, so did my tools. Today, nearly everything essential for my work seamlessly runs on a Mac. From &lt;em&gt;Visual Studio Code/Visual Studio&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Edge/Chrome Browser&lt;/em&gt;, to &lt;em&gt;Azure Data Studio&lt;/em&gt; (a shift from SSMS), and &lt;em&gt;.Net Core&lt;/em&gt; – each performs as well, if not better, than on my trusted Windows platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 is approaching us quickly. At the end of 2022, I would like to share 12 hand-picked ayaat (verses) from the Quran. May 2023 brings you happiness, peace and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So remember me I will remember you: Baqarah 152&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good. Alaraf 56&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned. Anbiya  35&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts  Al-Haj 46&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repel evil with that which is better. Al Muminun 96&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it is close behind you  - some of that for which you are impatient. Namlayat 72&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be, and it is. His command is only when he inteds a thing that he says to it &amp;ldquo;Be, and it is&amp;rdquo; Yasin 82&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the reward for good [anything] but good? Ar-Rahman 60&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And whoever puts all his trust in Allah (SWT) he will be enough for him At-Talaq 3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Verily with every hardship comes ease Ash-Sharh 5&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And when I am ill, it is He who cures me Ash-Shuara 80&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Recite in the name of your Lord who created man from a clinging substance.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will be a short post for those have a YouTube channel. Google recently introduced, Youtube Handles. YouTube handles helps make it easier for members of the community to find and connect with each other. Your handle will be unique to your channel and will be how people mention you in comments, community posts, and more. My YouTube channel handle is iGluonVinyls. Once you have your unique handle name, then you can get a unique URL for your channel as well. For example mine is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/igluonvinyls&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/igluonvinyls&lt;/a&gt; This URL is much easier to remember than the previous GUID based URL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a classic Rock fan. I bought a ticket to go with my brothers and daughter to see Roger Waters - This is not a drill in Cryptoarena Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the concert, sound, the environment was absolutely unreal to say the least. However, I must admit Roger&amp;rsquo;s politics is truly crazy. A picture collage of the event with family is below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/roger-with-brothers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Roger with Brothers&#34; title=&#34;Top Level Demonstration of Pulse Site&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;350&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I post a video of the opening in YouTube which got an expected number of views in a short time. Feel free to watch it &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/OUgTpLPYNrE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Work and personal commitments kept me writing these posts regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in the market in the last four weeks. It is with great pleasure we see some upside to the market, although today seem to be a wide spread down day on all three major indices. &lt;a href=&#34;../glosarry&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; is larking around 20-21 range. Remember, just a month or so back, it was around 30!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My reflections on Suratul Taha</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is different than what I have usually post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sura is Taha in Quran, and the sura summarizes the entire adventure when Allah appeared to Prophet Musa in the holy mountains of Tuwa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a few consecutive Ayaat, the sura describes the conversation between Allah and Musa. One of these conversations that touches me the most is when Allah asked Musa to go to Feraun to spread his word. Musa asks Allah, among other wishes, to remove his stutter and give him strength so that his voice and appearance are convincible to Feraun. Allah accepts his desire and says, &amp;ldquo;All that you requested has been granted, O Moses! &amp;quot; instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dow up 350 plus in the early trading, only to close -216 at the closing. All major indices gave up their gains and went into solid red. VIX edged up almost 5 percent. At the time of writing this post, all indices futures are flat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All indices were mostly negative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is much needed market rally with all indices in solid green territory and also VIX dropping below 25.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All eyes are on tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s CPI report. I think market is pricing in a very bad news. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe Powell fooled us stating &amp;ldquo;Inflation is transitory&amp;rdquo;. What happened to the &amp;ldquo;transition&amp;rdquo;? It feels like the inflation is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It appears, the market takes one step forward two step backward; I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it may change any time soon. &lt;a href=&#34;../glosarry&#34;&gt;Vix&lt;/a&gt; went up more than 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chinese stocks took a beating as Covid concern raises yet again. Shanghai will be conducting mass testing in several districts after Covid cases were detected earlier this week, a statement on the city’s WeChat account said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am not complaining, but just stating that volatility is at its worst or so it seems. All major indexes end up in green territory. Russell 2000 was down which measures growth sectors. VIX dropped another 3 percent and that is great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the end all indices end up higher almost one percent. &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; dropped below 28 with 7 percent decline, which indicates general &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt; in market is stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The market’s worst first half in 50 years. This is definitely something to be worried about and not just general &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt;. Feds are determined to get inflation numbers down, however, the persistent inflation is here to stay at least for the short term. War in Ukraine is never ending or so it seems. Oil prices inched up again today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Market is giving up slowly all the gains from last week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tesla stock is under fire, and heading towards hitting 650 a share. Recent news include, lay off of employees. Goldman expects weak Tesla results. Various analysts are revising their second quarter delivery numbers sighting issues with Covid shutdown in China etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a regular visitor of my site, you may have noticed, I have started posting daily closing bell stock market &lt;a href=&#34;../closing-bell-06282022&#34;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;. These pages proceeds with a Market index summary from that day. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss how I put it together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Hugo ShortCode?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shortcodes are simple snippets inside your content files calling built-in or custom templates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parts of the Stock Summary ShortCode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A JSON Payload for each day to summarize the data.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ShortCode HTML&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Insertion of the ShortCode into any Mark Down file.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below is a sample JSON Payload that the Short Code uses -&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All indices are in deep red territory with &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; surging back up above 28 again. Cathie Wood believes US is already in a recession. I think as  the month June ends and the market wraps up one of the worst six months of the year in stock market history, we can start to see some uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A big run on Friday and last week, one would assume a massive pull back today - did not happen. Definitely a good sign. &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;Russel 2K&lt;/a&gt; ended up green, which is usually indicator for the growth stocks. Read the following this weekend, wanted to share -&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All major indices were massively green for the day. Solid gains in S&amp;amp;P, Dow and Nasdaq - what a relief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dow - Up 4.73%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq Up 7.36%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P Up 5.76%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;glossary&#34;&gt;Russel 2K&lt;/a&gt;](../glossary) Up 4.92%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; Down 16.75%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above weekly summary is not something to pass by. We definitely see a market rebound. So does this mean the market had bottom, and we can expect a steady gains from here? I am not certain. There are still many market uncertainty out there. Not to mention wide spread &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; shows promise with less than 27.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am glad all indices ended up solid green at the closing bell. &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; continues to go down and that is the actual progress. Bond yields slip that is generally good for the market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tesla stocks are giving up steam, focusing on ongoing supply chain matters, China Covid resurgence. Supply chain issues are not new, however, Musk mentioning it in a crude way just gets the good old &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt; go out of control - hence drop in stock price. Fundamentally, not much has changed. The extreme volatility of Tesla stocks and their stock holders, will get rewarded for sticking through this roller coaster ride - I am sure of it.  After closing, TSLA ended up marginally higher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the Bing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-wallpaper?pc=W016&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrs0lbnSDb49ufCoyZPgW1J5XaEwN6n65MOUb7XTVzkHckVbkQWV8AxoC8a4QAvD_BwE&#34;&gt;wallpaper&lt;/a&gt; app. It is actually awesome, everyday I turn on my computer to see what kind of wall paper I get for that day. Most of these are amazing! I use them in my desktop and also as my zoom background! Finally, I created a small &lt;a href=&#34;https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Power Automate&lt;/a&gt; routine, that downloads each day Bing wall paper and saves it on to my drive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share some of these &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yaheya.com/gallery&#34;&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; images with you! Feel free to download them and use them as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Red day, although mid trading day all indexes were green but gave up all the gains by the closing bell. I am glad at least, the down turn is small essentially flat. &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; decreased, which is good. Ideally, we want to see it below 20. We have a long way to go up there!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All indexes are showing solid gains. The million dollar question is - the gain is here to stay?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; which measures public sentiment; remains high. In my opinion, &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt;= 28 indicates high [FUD](../(../glossary) (Fear Uncertainty Doubt). Recession fear looms. No doubt, small/large recession is forth coming. Today definitely not a good day to buy anything, as we should watch and monitor the market tomorrow. I certainly hope the gain retains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nasdaq which had taken the worst beating yesterday went up the highest. However, after a brutal day yesterday, one should expect a very green day - that was not the case. DJI essentially closed flat while S&amp;amp;P marginally up. I follow VLO which had a nice run and dropped a bit in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s gain was completely wiped and then added to some more losses. DJIA, Nasdaq hit fresh new lows. All investors want to know, is this the bottom or there are still room to go down! &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; is up almost 11.25 %. This indicates there is FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) exists. In my personal opinion, &lt;a href=&#34;../glossary&#34;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt;= 28 indicates extremely high buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After many years, moved my personal site to Hugo, previously DotNet Core Azure Web App. Details of current site can be found &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/about/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; which is the main platform this site runs under is a brilliant idea. Not all sites, needs to be generated off from a Database or need backend server technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site features -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disqus comments&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Contact form using Formspree&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overtime I plan to add many features and post about them as I am doing so. One such post is &lt;a href=&#34;../hugo-stock-summary-shortcode&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
