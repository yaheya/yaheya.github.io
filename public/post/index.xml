      <description>üéµ David Gilmour‚Äôs much-anticipated album Luck and Strange dropped on September 6, marking his first release in nine years since Rattle That Lock. Fans were eagerly waiting, especially after preview tracks like &amp;ldquo;The Piper‚Äôs Call,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Between Two Points,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dark and Velvet Nights&amp;rdquo; hinted at a mix of the familiar Pink Floyd essence and something new.&#xA;Gilmour doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Luck and Strange is a beautifully crafted work with his signature sound‚Äîsoaring guitar solos, bluesy undertones, and moments of poignant calm.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! I know it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last update ‚Äì things have been incredibly busy with both work and my YouTube channel!&#xA;Work Update:&#xA;On the professional side, we‚Äôre making solid progress on our massive ERP project: the Oracle Financial Cloud deployment. This project is a beast, with over a hundred swim lanes of technical and functional scopes. It‚Äôs definitely a challenge to keep up with everything that needs to be done between now and our launch date in July 2025.</description>

      <description>Those who know or follow me know I had my own Sole proprietorship in the early 1990s. I am very proud of what I did with my business back then; unfortunately, I had to close that business eventually due to demand from my daytime job. Recently, I started a new YouTube channel based on my old business name, &amp;ldquo;iGluon.&amp;rdquo; I have a lot of ideas to create content that users may find helpful.</description>

      <description>I am a classic Rock fan. I bought a ticket to go with my brothers and daughter to see Roger Waters - This is not a drill in Cryptoarena Los Angeles.&#xA;The quality of the concert, sound, the environment was absolutely unreal to say the least. However, I must admit Roger&amp;rsquo;s politics is truly crazy. A picture collage of the event with family is below.&#xA;I post a video of the opening in YouTube which got an expected number of views in a short time.</description>

      <description>This post is different than what I have usually post.&#xA;The sura is Taha in Quran, and the sura summarizes the entire adventure when Allah appeared to Prophet Musa in the holy mountains of Tuwa.&#xA;In a few consecutive Ayaat, the sura describes the conversation between Allah and Musa. One of these conversations that touches me the most is when Allah asked Musa to go to Feraun to spread his word.</description>

I think as the month June ends and the market wraps up one of the worst six months of the year in stock market history, we can start to see some uptrend.</description>

A big run on Friday and last week, one would assume a massive pull back today - did not happen. Definitely a good sign. Russel 2K ended up green, which is usually indicator for the growth stocks.</description>

      <description>I downloaded the Bing wallpaper app. It is actually awesome, everyday I turn on my computer to see what kind of wall paper I get for that day. Most of these are amazing! I use them in my desktop and also as my zoom background! Finally, I created a small Power Automate routine, that downloads each day Bing wall paper and saves it on to my drive.&#xA;I wanted to share some of these Bing images with you!</description>

Red day, although mid trading day all indexes were green but gave up all the gains by the closing bell. I am glad at least, the down turn is small essentially flat. VIX decreased, which is good. Ideally, we want to see it below 20.</description>
