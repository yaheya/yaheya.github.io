I didn\u0026rsquo;t just go to the movies. As I noted in my recent review, it felt more like a \u0026ldquo;pilgrimage.\u0026rdquo; The film was David Gilmour\u0026rsquo;s Live at the Circus Maximus, and it felt like a temporal echo—a chance to relive a legendary performance on a scale so grand it felt like you were breathing the very air of that historic night.\nHaving seen this tour live at the Hollywood Bowl last year (twice, in fact!), this was deeply personal for me. Seeing this film was like revisiting a cherished memory, but this time with a new, omniscient perspective.\nThe Silence of a Legend The film doesn\u0026rsquo;t start with a big musical crash. Instead, it opens with a powerful, knowing close-up of David Gilmour before a single note is played. His presence simply fills the screen. It was an unspoken declaration: \u0026ldquo;I am David Gilmour, and I am a\u0026hellip; legend.\u0026rdquo;\nThe whole theater erupted in applause and cheers at that moment. We were all there because we already knew and agreed with that statement.\nThe Circus Maximus as a Character From the first frame, you understand exactly why Gilmour chose this venue. The Circus Maximus isn\u0026rsquo;t just a stage; it\u0026rsquo;s a character in the performance. The film utilizes breathtaking drone shots, gliding over hallowed ground where chariots once thundered.\nSeeing that ancient space bathed in the ethereal glow of stage lights created a stunning juxtaposition of the eternal and the immediate. As I wrote in my review, \u0026ldquo;The ghosts of history feel like they’re listening alongside us.\u0026rdquo;\nA Sermon in Six Strings The musical journey was nothing short of spiritual.\n\u0026ldquo;5 A.M.\u0026rdquo;: The show opens with sublime, atmospheric grace, serving as a \u0026ldquo;dreamlike portal\u0026rdquo; into the concert.\n\u0026ldquo;Wish You Were Here\u0026rdquo;: This was the moment the venue became a \u0026ldquo;global campfire,\u0026rdquo; with thousands of voices singing that heartfelt plea back at the stage.\n\u0026ldquo;High Hopes\u0026rdquo;: The tolling bell echoing across the ruins was incredibly poignant—a message of longing that feels different in a place that has witnessed the rise and fall of empires.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorrow\u0026rdquo;: This was the absolute peak for me. That earth-shattering opening guitar riff felt like a \u0026ldquo;monolithic presence.\u0026rdquo; Hearing it echo through a venue that has witnessed millennia of human drama was a raw, powerful triumph.\nThe night concluded with \u0026ldquo;Comfortably Numb.\u0026rdquo; As the mirrorball fractured light across the Roman night, I actually teared up. The final solo was a \u0026ldquo;sermon in six strings\u0026rdquo;—agonizingly beautiful and breathtakingly powerful.\nThe Verdict The IMAX experience cannot fully replicate the visceral, electric energy of being physically present at a concert. However, it offers something else that is precious: intimacy. It is a front-row seat, a backstage pass, and a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye view all at once.\nAs the final notes faded, my overwhelming feeling was one of deep gratitude. This film is a beautifully crafted testament to an artist still at the peak of his powers, creating timeless music in a timeless city.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a movie. It was magic.\n","date":"February 4, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/post/circus-maximus/","section":"Posts","summary":"I want to talk about an experience I had last night.

The topic was Cloud Native Application Development, but the underlying theme was much deeper: the urgent need to bridge the historical divide between those who write the code and those who manage the systems that run it.\nFor years, the industry relied on a Lift and Shift strategy. While this moved us to the cloud, it often failed to unlock true application scalability and infrastructure efficiency. To move forward, we have to acknowledge that infrastructure considerations can no longer be an afterthought—they must become integral to the application development lifecycle.\nHere is a summary of the core concepts we discussed regarding the shift to a collaborative, Cloud-Native future.\nThe Core Characteristics of Cloud Native # Cloud native is not just about where the application lives; it is about how it is built, packaged, and managed. We broke this down into four pillars:\nModular Architecture: Moving away from monolithic structures toward service-based designs. This requires infrastructure that supports a distributed nature, involving changes to network configurations, load balancing, and inter-service communication. Standardized Containerization: Using consistent packaging across environments. This facilitates Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing infrastructure teams to manage resources programmatically to support specific application needs. Automated Management: Leveraging platforms for automated resource handling[cite: 77]. This requires \u0026ldquo;Team Synergy,\u0026rdquo; where developers and infrastructure engineers collaborate on resource definitions and scaling policies. Integrated DevOps: Merging development and operations practices[cite: 79]. Pipelines must now include the automated provisioning of necessary cloud infrastructure, not just code deployment. The End of \u0026ldquo;It Works on My Machine\u0026rdquo; # One of the most significant shifts in this new model is the developer workflow[cite: 136]. In the traditional on-premise model, developers worked in silos within static environments[cite: 117]. Code was written locally, and if it worked on localhost, it was considered ready, often leading to the infamous \u0026ldquo;It works on my machine!\u0026rdquo; defense when production issues arose[cite: 119].\nIn a Cloud-Native environment, we move toward Infrastructure Awareness.\nThe Old Way: Local debugging on a flat, open internal network where the developer is unaware of infrastructure constraints[cite: 147, 148]. The New Way: Remote debugging using cloud-specific extensions where the code interacts with dynamic resources[cite: 151, 163]. This shift eliminates the friction between Dev and Ops by ensuring that Dev, Test, and Prod environments are identical through declarative configuration[cite: 172, 174].\nOperational Excellence is a Shared Responsibility # Building resilient applications is no longer solely an application concern; it requires a shared responsibility model[cite: 180, 189].\nFor example, achieving true fault tolerance and self-healing systems requires correct configuration of infrastructure components like Availability Zones and Auto-Scaling groups[cite: 198]. A developer might write efficient code, but if the infrastructure isn\u0026rsquo;t configured to handle a zone failure, the application fails. Conversely, infrastructure can be perfect, but if the application isn\u0026rsquo;t designed to be stateless, auto-scaling will break the user experience[cite: 103].\nReal-World Application: The UCSB AI Initiative # We are not just talking about theory; we are applying these principles to the UCSB Generative AI Project[cite: 246, 284]. As shown in our architectural breakdown, this project utilizes a complex mesh of AWS services including:\nCompute \u0026amp; API: AWS Lambda (FastAPI/WebSocket) and API Gateway. AI/ML: Amazon Bedrock (Converse API and Knowledge Bases). Data \u0026amp; Storage: DynamoDB, S3, and OpenSearch Serverless. Building a system like this is impossible in a silo. It requires a roadmap that relies on deep collaboration between Application Development and Infrastructure Engineering teams[cite: 244].\nThe Road Ahead # Our strategic goal is to transition strategically towards these real-world cloud-native practices[cite: 240]. This is a journey that moves through three phases: Foundation, Migration, and Optimization, eventually leading to Innovation.\nThe technology is ready. The tools are powerful. The key to unlocking them is breaking down the silos and recognizing that in a cloud-native world, we are all engineers of the same system.\nSlide Deck\n","date":"January 3, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/post/cloud-native/","section":"Posts","summary":"I recently had the privilege of presenting to the Developer Collaboration group at UC Santa Barbara, a gathering of both Software Developers and Infrastructure Engineers.

Welcome to 2026.\nAs the calendar turns a new page, I find myself reflecting on the moments that brought us here—the joys, the challenges, and the quiet resilience we’ve all built. As per my yearly tradition, I wanted to share something that grounds me and brings peace to my soul.\nNo matter what this new year holds, there is timeless comfort to be found in the words of the Quran. Here are 10 verses that I hope will wrap your heart in warmth, remind you of your strength, and reassure you that you are never walking alone. May 2026 be a year of ease, growth, and abundant mercy for us all.\nFor when the path feels uncertain \u0026ldquo;And He is with you wherever you are.\u0026rdquo; — Surah Al-Hadid (57:4)\nA promise of relief \u0026ldquo;For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.

Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; — Surah Az-Zumar (39:53)\nA reminder of your strength \u0026ldquo;Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.\u0026rdquo; — Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286)\nFor ultimate tranquility \u0026ldquo;Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured.\u0026rdquo; — Surah Ar-Ra\u0026rsquo;d (13:28)\nWhen you need hope for the future \u0026ldquo;You know not; perhaps Allah will bring about, after that, a [new] matter.\u0026rdquo; — Surah At-Talaq (65:1)\nA reminder of His immense love \u0026ldquo;My mercy encompasses all things.\u0026rdquo; — Surah Al-A\u0026rsquo;raf (7:156)\nFor never feeling abandoned \u0026ldquo;Your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muhammad], nor has He detested [you].\u0026rdquo; — Surah Ad-Duha (93:3)\nThe secret to abundance in 2026 \u0026ldquo;If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor].\u0026rdquo; — Surah Ibrahim (14:7)\n","date":"January 3, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/post/happy-2026/","section":"Posts","summary":"Happy New Year, everyone!

This preference is rooted in audio fidelity, design philosophy, and specific requirements for turntable playback.\nFocus on Audio Purity and Quality An integrated stereo amplifier is designed with a single, uncompromising goal: to take a two-channel signal and amplify it with the highest possible fidelity. Dedicated Resources: A stereo amplifier channels its entire budget and design effort into only two amplifier channels (Left and Right), plus a pre-amplifier section. This means the manufacturer can invest in higher-quality components for the power supply, capacitors, and internal circuitry compared to an AVR at a similar price point.\nLess Interference (Simpler Design): AV receivers are complex hubs that house not only multiple amplifier channels (5.1, 7.1, 9.2, etc.) but also numerous video processors, digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and surround-sound decoding chips (Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, etc.). This abundance of digital and video circuitry in close proximity can introduce electrical noise that can subtly degrade the delicate analog audio signal. A stereo amplifier has a much simpler internal layout, leading to a \u0026ldquo;cleaner\u0026rdquo; signal path.\nTargeted Power: While an AVR may advertise high wattage, that power is often split among seven or more channels. A dedicated stereo amplifier\u0026rsquo;s power rating is solely for the two main channels, ensuring it can better drive demanding or larger stereo speakers to their full potential without strain.\nThe Essential Phono Stage for Turntables The signal produced by a turntable\u0026rsquo;s cartridge is extremely weak and requires special treatment—it is not a standard \u0026ldquo;line-level\u0026rdquo; signal like that from a CD player or streamer. Amplification and Equalization: A turntable signal needs to be amplified to line level, and it also requires RIAA equalization (Recording Industry Association of America curve) to correct the severe low-frequency cut and high-frequency boost applied during the vinyl mastering process. This essential component is called a phono stage or phono preamp.\nSuperior Built-in Phono Stages: High-quality integrated stereo amplifiers, particularly those built by hi-fi companies, are much more likely to include a high-performance, dedicated phono input. This built-in phono stage is often superior in quality to the one found in budget-to-mid-range AV receivers, which may treat the phono stage as an afterthought.\nAnalog Preservation: Vinyl playback is a fundamentally analog process. Stereo amplifiers are typically better optimized for handling, preserving, and amplifying this purely analog signal path without unnecessary digital conversion, which can be critical for audiophiles seeking the authentic \u0026ldquo;warmth\u0026rdquo; of vinyl.\n","date":"November 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/post/amp-versus-reciever/","section":"Posts","summary":"For listeners whose primary focus is two-channel (stereo) music listening, especially the rich, analog sound of vinyl records, a dedicated integrated stereo amplifier (often just called a stereo amplifier) is generally preferred over a multi-channel AV receiver (AVR).

For enterprise LLM deployment, we must solve three non-negotiables: latency, data gravity, and resiliency.\nCross-region inference in Bedrock is the definitive answer, moving LLM strategy from experiment to production-grade architecture.\nThe Pillars of Multi-Region LLM Architecture\nHigh Resiliency and Failover Single-region deployment is a critical vulnerability. Cross-region inference allows immediate, automatic failover (e.g., from us-east-1 to us-west-2). This maintains API parity and model consistency across geographies, guaranteeing uninterrupted service for critical applications.\nData Gravity and Compliance International operation mandates that data processing often occurs where the data resides (Data Gravity). This is essential for compliance (e.g., GDPR). Cross-region inference lets us run the same foundational model locally (e.g., in eu-central-1), keeping prompts and responses within necessary jurisdictional boundaries while standardizing the service platform.\nGlobal Latency Optimization For interactive applications, every millisecond counts. By intelligently routing user requests to the closest available and operational endpoint, cross-region deployment minimizes network latency. This ensures a fast, consistent, and performant user experience for a global user base.\nThe Architect’s Mandate Bedrock handles the model deployment complexity. Our focus shifts to the infrastructure:\nSmart Routing: Using services like Route 53 for latency-based routing to the fastest region.\nGlobal State: Ensuring conversational state (chat history) is managed in a globally replicated, low-latency data store (like DynamoDB Global Tables).\nCross-region inference is the essential capability for building the next generation of resilient, compliant, and globally distributed LLM applications.\nWhat are your thoughts on state management in this multi-region environment?

Remember, just a month or so back, it was around 30!\nDespite all these positive news, major analysts predict that a mild to a severe recession is facing us perhaps early to mid 2023. One can argue, we are already in a recession as GDP growth has been negative for two consecutive quarters. Here is a great article on how economists determine, if we are on a recession.\nBiden administration passed an impressive \u0026ldquo;Inflation Reduction Act\u0026rdquo; that may aid the market. Although, some experts argue, the additional government spending (almost a trillion dollars) may put gasoline on inflation fire that is burning out of control. Speaking on inflation, we continue to observe a slight downward trend in July which was accepted widely by the market. Gas prices has been consistently going down which is also a positive sign that we may end a soft landing and avoid a recession.\nRetail investors need to be cautious now than ever in my opinion. This is a difficult time, and the 2020, invest and get 100 % return on most stocks are gone. Now we see traditional 10-15 % return, if we are lucky. Most portfolios have been slashed 40-50 % depending on how aggressive your investment strategy is. Despite, all this caution, US economy is one that is strong.

One of these conversations that touches me the most is when Allah asked Musa to go to Feraun to spread his word. Musa asks Allah, among other wishes, to remove his stutter and give him strength so that his voice and appearance are convincible to Feraun. Allah accepts his desire and says, \u0026ldquo;All that you requested has been granted, O Moses! \u0026quot; instantaneously.\nImagine for a second the magnitude of this event. You are standing in front of all merciful and generous Allah, having a dialogue with him, asking for your needs, and instantly they are granted.\nWhile we probably will not meet Allah in this world, we may not get the granted assurance from Allah instantly either. Nevertheless, Allah says, \u0026ldquo;So remember me, I will remember you.\u0026rdquo; The Ayaat essentially means the same wish-granting promise as Musa, except perhaps we are not hearing or feeling the presence of Allah just in front of us.\nOur duas are one of the highest Ibadah we can perform and one that Allah prefers. We should never go astray from it and have faith that they are all being heard, and in time we will get the appropriate response that is best for us.\nWe are all struggling in our lives one way or the other.
