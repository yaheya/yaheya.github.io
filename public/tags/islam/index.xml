      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the privilege of presenting to the Developer Collaboration group at UC Santa Barbara, a gathering of both Software Developers and Infrastructure Engineers.  The topic was &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native Application Development&lt;/strong&gt;, but the underlying theme was much deeper: the urgent need to bridge the historical divide between those who write the code and those who manage the systems that run it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, the industry relied on a Lift and Shift strategy.  While this moved us to the cloud, it often failed to unlock true application scalability and infrastructure efficiency.  To move forward, we have to acknowledge that infrastructure considerations can no longer be an afterthought—they must become integral to the application development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year, everyone! Welcome to 2026.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the calendar turns a new page, I find myself reflecting on the moments that brought us here—the joys, the challenges, and the quiet resilience we’ve all built. As per my yearly tradition, I wanted to share something that grounds me and brings peace to my soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what this new year holds, there is timeless comfort to be found in the words of the Quran. Here are 10 verses that I hope will wrap your heart in warmth, remind you of your strength, and reassure you that you are never walking alone. May 2026 be a year of ease, growth, and abundant mercy for us all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
