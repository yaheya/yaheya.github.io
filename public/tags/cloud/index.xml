      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent any time on YouTube lately, you know the feeling. You go to watch a specific tutorial or a playlist, and before you know it, you’re buried under a mountain of unrelated recommendations, &amp;ldquo;up next&amp;rdquo; videos that have nothing to do with your interests, and a search bar that seems to want to show you everything except what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a creator, I found it increasingly frustrated that my best content—especially my deep-dive playlists—was getting lost in the &amp;ldquo;clutter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the privilege of presenting to the Developer Collaboration group at UC Santa Barbara, a gathering of both Software Developers and Infrastructure Engineers.  The topic was &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native Application Development&lt;/strong&gt;, but the underlying theme was much deeper: the urgent need to bridge the historical divide between those who write the code and those who manage the systems that run it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, the industry relied on a Lift and Shift strategy.  While this moved us to the cloud, it often failed to unlock true application scalability and infrastructure efficiency.  To move forward, we have to acknowledge that infrastructure considerations can no longer be an afterthought—they must become integral to the application development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
