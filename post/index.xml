The sura is Taha in Quran, and the sura summarizes the entire adventure when Allah appeared to Prophet Musa in the holy mountains of Tuwa.
In a few consecutive Ayaat, the sura describes the conversation between Allah and Musa. One of these conversations that touches me the most is when Allah asked Musa to go to Feraun to spread his word.</description></item><item><title>Closing Bell 07-18-2022</title><link>/post/closing-bell-07182022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/closing-bell-07182022/</guid><description>Market Summary Index Value Change Percentage Dow 31,072.61 -215.65 -0.69 S&amp;amp;P 500 3,830.85 -32.31 -0.84 Nasdaq 11,360.05 -92.37 -0.81 Russel 2K 1,738.42 -5.96 -0.34 VIX 25.30 1.07 4.42 What a turn of events.
